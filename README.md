# Agriculture Risk Prediction
Machine learning project that predicts agricultural risk levels using country-based agricultural datasets. Developed during the W-Code 2.0 AI &amp; Data Science Bootcamp by Kodluyoruz.


#Agriculture Risk Prediction â€“ Graduation Project (W-Code 2.0)

This project was developed as part of the **W-Code 2.0: Data Science and AI Bootcamp**, organized by **Kodluyoruz** and **Akbank Teknoloji**.  
We built a machine learning model that analyzes country-based agricultural datasets and predicts potential risk factors that may affect agricultural production.

##Project Goal

To help visualize and predict the impact of different agricultural variables (climate, soil, production factors, etc.) on overall farming risk levels using real-world datasets.

## Team Members

- Sena KonukoÄŸlu
- Ã‡iÄŸdem YaÅŸar

## Technologies Used

- **Python**
- **Pandas** â€“ data manipulation
- **NumPy** â€“ numerical operations
- **Seaborn** â€“ data visualization
- **Scikit-learn** â€“ machine learning algorithms
- **Matplotlib** â€“ plotting support
- **Jupyter Notebook**

## Dataset

We used a dataset named `Enhanced_Climate_Data_Strong_Correlations.xlsx` containing country-level climate and agricultural indicators.  
It was cleaned, transformed, and used to train/test a classification model.

## Machine Learning Process

- Feature selection and preprocessing
- Supervised learning algorithms for classification
- Accuracy & risk evaluation
- Risk level prediction based on agricultural indicators
- Visualization with Seaborn & Plotly
